Stress Relief Breathing Exercise.", "description": "5 things to consider before choosing a breathing app:\r\n\u2b50\ufe0f Warning! Many breathing apps instruct you to inhale and exhale at a constant speed. This does not just feel unnatural, it can even cause you to adopt an unhealthy way of breathing, which can lead to health issues. Beware, even some of the most downloaded apps make this mistake!\r\nBreath Ball's breathing is based on clinical observations of hundreds of humans. The app was specifically designed for clinical environments. That's why Breath Balls breathing exercises feel natural and work much better than any of the competing apps.\r\n\u2b50\ufe0f No quackery: Breath Ball is based on sound scientific research. New breathing exercises are added only when there is sufficient research data available.\r\nHowever, you can of course define your own breathing exercises and use Breath Ball for whatever you want.\r\n\u2b50\ufe0f Maximum customizability: Our well being highly depends on what we like and dislike. Breath Ball is the only app you can fully customize to your liking: Colors, breathing exercises and even the size of the user interface can be adjusted to give you the breathing app that feels just right for you.\r\n\u2b50\ufe0f Focus on simplicity: Breath Ball is incredibly easy to use and even the first breathing session usually leads to great results.\r\n\u2b50\ufe0f Free: Even the free version of Breath Ball provides all the functionality you'll ever need.\r\n\r\nThese are the main reasons why leading medical professionals, therapists and biofeedback coaches use and recommend Breath Ball.\r\n\r\nWhat is Breath Ball used for?\r\nBreath Ball helps you to relieve stress and anxiety, soothe the symptoms of COPD and Asthma, lower high blood pressure and overcome sleeplessness with four easy breathing exercises. What might sound too simple to be true, is actually based on latest scientific research and is used to treat patients at rehab facilities and in clinical environments. So let's take a closer look at Breath Ball's breathing exercises and what they can do for you:\r\n\r\nBreath Ball provides breathing exercises for these four use cases:\r\n\r\n\u2b50\ufe0f The cardiac coherence breathing exercise is used to relieve stress and anxiety. It is thought to patients at rehab and bio-feedback trainings to help them get calm and relax.\r\n\r\n\u2b50\ufe0f The COPD foundation\u2019s recommended breathing technique helps to relieve the\r\nsymptoms of Asthma and COPD.\r\n\r\n\u2b50\ufe0f Slow paced breathing is a complementary treatment against hypertension (high blood pressure). It goes back to Prof. Dr. Loew and is commonly used in clinical environments.\r\n\r\n\u2b50\ufe0f Dr. Andrew Weil\u2019s famous 4:7:8 breathing technique is used to get calm to fall asleep.\r\n\r\nEach of these breathing exercises comes with a short tutorial that will get you started in less than two minutes. Beside that you can create your own breathing exercises; something yoga and pranayama coaches enjoy a lot.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrivacy concerns?\r\nPlease note: We truly value your privacy. Breath Ball does not collect any of your personal data. There is no Facebook integration and there are no social sharing features included. If you decide to use this app, you do so absolutely anonymous.\r\n\r\nBreath Ball is a philanthropic project and you are more than welcome to use it. In case of questions or suggestions feel free to drop as an email at michael@breathball.com\r\n\r\nThanks for reading.
